Cookbook Randomizer App
(Android App)

Function: 
The main purpose of this app is to provide to the user a random recipe that they might like to prepare. This would do away with a person’s tendency to not really want anything in particular; the ability to ask the app to give ideas until the user finds one he/she likes will make it easier to decide what the user wants to prepare for dinner, or any other meal. Being told what you want to cook makes it easier to just do it, rather than just wait for oneself to come to decision on their own.

Target Audience: 
Anybody who cooks food. A mother or father preparing dinner for their family might use the app for ideas and new recipes when the family doesn’t have a clear preference for anything in particular. It might also help an indecisive single person decide what they want to cook if they’ve grown tired of the same old recipes. 

Notes:
-Comes preloaded with a number or random recipes (16 at the time of writing this). Ideally there would be many more, and more would be added with updates.
-User can add new recipes of their own to the pool of randoms to personalize their cooking experience.
